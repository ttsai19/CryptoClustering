# Crypto Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning clustering techniques to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The goal is to group cryptocurrencies into clusters based on their performance metrics, such as price changes over different time periods. By leveraging **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, we identify patterns and relationships in the data.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning clustering and data preprocessing.
- **hvPlot**: For interactive visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: For static data visualizations.

## Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project contains performance metrics for various cryptocurrencies, including:

- **price_change_percentage_24h**
- **price_change_percentage_7d**
- **price_change_percentage_14d**
- **price_change_percentage_30d**
- **price_change_percentage_60d**
- **price_change_percentage_200d**
- **price_change_percentage_1y**

The dataset includes a total of 125 cryptocurrencies.
